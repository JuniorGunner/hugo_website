As a skilled Backend Software Engineer with extensive experience in software development, I am well-versed in a range of technologies, including Python, Django, Flask, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, and Redis. Additionally, I have a strong background in cloud technologies, having worked extensively with Amazon Web Services (AWS), including AWS Lambda, API Gateway, Aurora, DynamoDB, S3, SQS, SAM, and CDK, as well as Google Cloud Platform. I also have strong experience in databases (relational and NoSQL) such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server, MongoDB

At **Erudit**, I played a key role in the development of a serverless application using Python and AWS Lambda. By leveraging AWS services such as API Gateway, Aurora, DynamoDB, and S3, I was able to build scalable and reliable solutions for our customers.

At **Scrimmage**, I was responsible for the design and maintenance of backend systems using Python, Django, Django Rest Framework, and Flask. I have experience working with various databases, including Postgres, MongoDB, and Redis.

At **Estante MÃ¡gica**, I developed microservices using Python and FastAPI, containerized with Docker, and deployed to Google Cloud Platform.

Prior to my software engineering roles, I worked as an Information Technology Analyst at **Votorantim**, where I utilized my expertise in Python and Django to build data analysis tools using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Plotly. Additionally, I have experience in web scraping and crawling, using tools such as Scrapy and Scrapinghub.

Furthermore, I have also worked as an IT Technician at **Sorocaba Technological College**, where I was responsible for managing and maintaining IT labs and the campus network. My skills include network management, hardware and software support, user support, and Active Directory administration.
